            <summary>
                Gives the provider the opportunity to initialize itself.
            </summary>
            <param name="providerInfo"> The information about the provider that is being started. </param>
            <returns> Either the providerInfo that was passed or a derived class of ProviderInfo that was initialized with the provider information that was passed. </returns>
            <remarks>
                The default implementation returns the ProviderInfo instance that
                was passed.To have session state maintain persisted data on behalf
                of the provider, the provider should derive from
                <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo"/>
                and add any properties or methods for the data it wishes to persist.
                When Start gets called the provider should construct an instance of
                its derived ProviderInfo using the providerInfo that is passed in
                and return that new instance.

        <member name="M:ClrPlus.Powershell.Azure.Provider.AzureProvider.NewDrive(System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo)">
            <summary>
                Gives the provider an opportunity to validate the drive that is
                being added.  It also allows the provider to modify parts of the
                PSDriveInfo object.  This may be done for performance or
                reliability reasons or to provide extra data to all calls using
                the Drive.
            </summary>
            <param name="drive"> The proposed new drive. </param>
            <returns>
                The new drive that is to be added to the Windows PowerShell namespace. This can either be the same
                <paramref name="drive"/>
                object that was passed in or a modified version of it. The default implementation returns the drive that was passed.
            </returns>
            <remarks>
                This method gives the provider an opportunity to associate
                provider specific information with a drive. This is done by
                deriving a new class from
                <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo"/>
                and adding any properties, methods, or fields that are necessary.
                When this method gets called, the override should create an instance
                of the derived PSDriveInfo using the passed in PSDriveInfo. The derived
                PSDriveInfo should then be returned. Each subsequent call into the provider
                that uses this drive will have access to the derived PSDriveInfo via the
                PSDriveInfo property provided by the base class. Implementers of this
                method should verify that the root exists and that a connection to
                the data store (if there is one) can be made.  Any failures should
                be sent to the
                <see cref="M:System.Management.Automation.Provider.CmdletProvider.WriteError(System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord)"/>
                method and null should be returned.

        <member name="M:ClrPlus.Powershell.Azure.Provider.AzureProvider.InitializeDefaultDrives">
            <summary>
                Allows the provider to map drives after initialization.
            </summary>
            <returns>
                A drive collection with the drives that the provider wants to be added to the session upon initialization. The default implementation returns an empty
                <see cref="T:System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo"/>
                collection.
            </returns>
            <remarks>
                After the Start method is called on a provider, the
                InitializeDefaultDrives method is called. This is an opportunity
                for the provider to mount drives that are important to it. For
                instance, the Active Directory provider might mount a drive for
                the defaultNamingContext if the machine is joined to a domain.
                All providers should mount a root drive to help the user with
                discoverability. This root drive might contain a listing of a set
                of locations that would be interesting as roots for other mounted
                drives. For instance, the Active Directory provider may create a
                drive that lists the naming contexts found in the namingContext
                attributes on the RootDSE. This will help users discover
                interesting mount points for other drives.
